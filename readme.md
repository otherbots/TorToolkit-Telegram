Direct Clone and Run

Run the following commands. (Following commands can be used to setup the vps from scratch)
   
    git clone https://github.com/yash-dk/TorToolkit-Telegram.git
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3.8
    sudo apt install -y python3-venv
    python3 -m venv venv

	apt-get install -y software-properties-common
	apt-get -y update
	add-apt-repository -y ppa:qbittorrent-team/qbittorrent-stable

After that setup the database:-
Remember the 'your-pass' that you enter below

    sudo -u postgres bash
    createdb tortk
    psql
    ALTER USER postgres with password 'your-pass';
    exit
    exit
After that setup the Variables.
	Assuming that you are in the dir where you clonned the repo
	   
     cd TorToolkit-Telegram/tortoolkit/consts
	 nano ExecVarsSample.py

Change the API_HASH, API_ID, BOT_TOKEN, ALD_USR and BASE_URL_OF_BOT
Change DB_URI = "dbname=tortk user=postgres password=your-pass host=127.0.0.1 port=5432"
enter the password in the above string
After that run (You can use any port for the web interface here i am using 80)
Each time before starting the bot export the port Number

    export PORT=80

And finally run ./start.sh in clonned folder.

    chmod 777 start.sh
    ./start.sh
